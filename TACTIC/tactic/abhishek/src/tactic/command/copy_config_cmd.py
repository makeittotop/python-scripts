        How to do this?

        We need a way of copying a view ... easy enough

        If a template is specified, start with that.  No copying.
        If changes are made, a copy is made and stored in the database.  The
            database version is now used
        What to do when upgrading and new tabs are available or have changed?
            - need some kind of diff, but we can deal with that later.
