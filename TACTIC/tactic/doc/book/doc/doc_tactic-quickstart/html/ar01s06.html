sequences etc that are checked in from a users computer to the servers
central repository. This process is no different than if the user were
to correctly name and place the files on the server individually but,
TACTIC handles this automatically resulting in a clean, organized
repository.</p><p>As a user there is also no need to worry about the versioning files as
this is automated through the snapshot records. You simply choose which
process the file is being checked into and TACTIC handles the rest.</p><p>When s file is checked in, an entry is created for that item which
contain references to the process, version, date/time, who did it and
where the file is on the server. If tasks exist for the item, check-ins
often occur against those tasks which results in a direct relationship
between the task and the check in providing a history of files for that
particular process.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Naming Conventions</strong></span></p><p>Naming conventions in TACTIC are used to automate the naming of the
directories and files in the central repository. Although strictly
controlled, it is important to note that these conventions are
configurable and are simply used to guide where the files are stored. By
default TACTIC is delivered with a set of naming conventions that often
work well.</p><p>How naming conventions work is that a check in occurs, TACTIC is able to
use information about the item being checked into, the task and the new
version information to properly control where the files are copied to
and what they are named in the repository. For example if checking into
"design" for "character001" and the next version is 4, the resulting
file structure might look like:</p><pre class="screen">my_project/assets/character001/design/character001_design_004.jpg</pre><p><span class="strong"><strong>Latest and Current</strong></span></p><p>When files are checked in, it is often good to know which version is the
latest version. Although at times, the highest version or last check in
is not the version that should be delivered. "Current" is a way of
flagging a check in as the deliverable check-in regardless of what the
version number is. For example, you may have versions 1-10 for a
"design" process but, version 7 is the approved deliverable check-in.
Setting this check-in to "current" will flag it as the deliverable for
either downstream pipeline processes or, for final delivery.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Versionless</strong></span></p><p>By default, TACTIC simply created a new version within a process each
time a check in occurs. Users can then checkout the desired version
either by current/latest or by choosing a version. On top of this is the
ability to generate a latest or current versionless files each time the
current/or latest changes either during a check in or manually in the
interface. This file is either a direct copy or a link depending on the
setting in your project.</p><p>For more information on configuring version less check-ins, please
